* {datasetAPI}/collections/{coverageid}/coverage/rangeset?subset=Lat(40:50),Lon(10:20) -- returns a coverage cutout (sample values only) between (Lat: 40, Lon: 10) and (Lat: 50, Lon: 20), in the negotiated format
* {datasetAPI}/collections/{coverageid}/coverage/rangeset?subset=time("2019-03-27") -- returns a coverage slice (sample values only) at the timestamp given, with all data available in the other dimensions (in case the coverage is Lat/Lon/time the result will be a 2D image with its full Lat/Lon extent)
* {datasetAPI}/collections/{coverageid}/coverage?subset=Lat(40:50),Lon(10:20) -- returns a cutout from the coverage identified with extent between corner coordinates (Lat: 40, Lon: 10) and (Lat: 50, Lon: 20)
* {datasetAPI}/collections/{coverageid}/coverage/rangeset?subset=Lat(40:50),Lon(10:20)  -- returns the range set of a coverage cutout between (Lat: 40, Lon: 10) and (Lat: 50, Lon: 20), in the negotiated format; no domain set, range type, or metadata will be returned
* {datasetAPI}/collections/{coverageid}/coverage?subset=time("2019-03-27") -- returns a coverage slice at the timestamp given (in case the coverage is Lat/Lon/time the result will be a 2D image)
