=== Evolution from OGC Web Services

OGC Web Service (OWS) standards implemented a Remote-Procedure-Call-over-HTTP architectural style using XML for payloads. This was the state-of-the-art when OGC Web Services were originally designed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The OGC API (OAPI) Common specifies the common kernel of an API approach to services that follows the current Web architecture. In particular, the <<SDWBP,W3C/OGC best practices for sharing Spatial Data on the Web>> as well as the <<DWBP,W3C best practices for sharing Data on the Web>>.

Beside the general alignment with the architecture of the Web (e.g., consistency with HTTP/HTTPS, hypermedia controls), another goal for OGC API standards is modularization. This goal has several facets:

* Clear separation between core requirements and more advanced capabilities. This document specifies the requirements that are relevant for almost everyone who wants to share or use coverage data on a fine-grained level. Additional capabilities that several communities are using today will be specified as extensions to the Core API.
* Technologies that change more frequently are decoupled and specified in separate modules ("requirements classes" in OGC terminology). This enables, for example, the use/re-use of new encodings for spatial data or API descriptions.
* Modularization is not just about a single "service". OGC APIs will provide building blocks that can be reused in APIs in general. In other words, a server supporting the WCS 3.0 API should not be seen as a standalone WCS service.  Rather it should be viewed as a collection of API building blocks which together implement WCS 3.0 capabilities. A corollary of this is that it should be possible to implement an API that simultaneously conforms to conformance classes from WFS 3.0, WCS 3.0 and other OGC Web API standards.

This approach intends to support two types of client developers:

* Those that have never heard about OGC. Developers should be able to create a client using the API definition without the need to read an OGC standard (they may need to learn a little bit about geometry, etc.);
* Those that want to write a "generic" client that can access OGC APIs, i.e. are not specific for a particular API.

As a result of this modernization, OGC API implementations are not backwards compatible with OWS implementations per se. However, a design goal is to define OGC APIs in a way so that an OAPI interface can be mapped to a OWS implementation. OGC APIs are intended to be simpler and more modern, but still an evolution from the previous versions and their implementations.

The modernization is discussed in more detail link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/OAPI_Common/blob/master/overview.md[here].

=== Encodings

[NOTE]
========
Metadata will be returned as well as coveraged.  So HTML and GeoJSON should be included for this purpose.  Additional encodings will be needed to support coverage responses.
========

This standard does not mandate any encoding or format. But it does provide extensions for encodings which are commonly used in OGC APIs.  In addition to HTML as the standard encoding for Web content, rules for commonly used encodings for spatial data on the web are provided (GeoJSON, GML).

None of these encodings is mandatory and an implementation of the _Core_ requirements class may implement none of them. Alternatively, an implementation of the _Core_ requirements class may choose to implement completely different encodings instead.

<<rec_html,Support for HTML is recommended>>. HTML is the core language of the World Wide Web. An API that supports HTML will support browsing the spatial resources with a web browser and will also enable search engines to crawl and index those resources.

GeoJSON is a commonly used format that is simple to understand and well supported by tools and software libraries. Since most Web developers are comfortable with using a JSON-based format, it is <<rec_geojson,recommended for APIs which expose feature data>> as long as the data can be represented in GeoJSON for the intended use.

Some examples of cases that are out-of-scope for GeoJSON are:

* When solids are used for geometries (e.g. in a 3D city model),
* Geometries that include non-linear curve interpolations
that cannot be simplified (e.g., use of arcs in authoritative geometries),
* Geometries that have to be represented in a coordinate reference system that is not based on WGS 84 longitude/latitude (e.g. an authoritative national reference system),
* Features that have more than one geometric property.

The recommendations for using HTML and GeoJSON reflect the importance of HTML and the current popularity of JSON-based data formats. As the practices in the Web community evolve, the recommendations will likely be updated in future versions of this standard to provide guidance on using other encodings.

This part of the OAPI standard does not provide any guidance on other encodings. The supported encodings, or more precisely the media types of the supported encodings, can be determined from the API definition. The desired encoding is selected using HTTP content negotiation.

For example, if the server supports link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8142[GeoJSON Text Sequences] an encoding that is based on JSON text sequences, and GeoJSON, and supports streaming by making the data incrementally parseable, could use the media type `application/geo+json-seq`.

In addition, HTTP supports compression. Therefore the standard HTTP compression mechanisms can be used to reduce the size of messages between the server and the client.

=== Examples

[NOTE]
========
Update the following content once a coverage example has been agreed on.
========

This document uses a simple example throughout the document: The dataset contains buildings and the API provides access to them through a single feature collection ("buildings") and two encodings, GeoJSON and HTML.

The buildings have a few (optional) properties: the polygon geometry of the building footprint, a name, the function of the building (residential, commercial or public use), the floor count and the timestamp of the last update of the building feature in the dataset.

This example serves to illustrate the concepts underlying OGC APIs. It does not indicate that OGC APIs are always feature based. Other resource types can and will be implemented as well. But the basic capapablities described in this specification will apply to all.
