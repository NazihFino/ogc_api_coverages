== OAPI - Coverages Processing Extension

This extension allows sending a WCPS request to a server for server-side filtering, processing, and fusion, generally: analytics on a coverage server.

To this end, the Processing Extension adds query parameters to the server offering. The query parameter is operating on collection level as any number of coverages can be combined:

    Q={wcps-query}

where {wcps-query} is a syntactically and semantically correct WCPS query.

The output is a (possibly empty) list of coverages or scalars, depending on the query result type.

Example:

    http://acme.com/oapi/collections?Q=for $c in (ERA5-cube) return max( $c.temperature )

Error conditions:

*    The query must be syntactically and semantically correct.
