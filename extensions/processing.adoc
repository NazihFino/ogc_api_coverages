== OAPI - Coverages Processing Extension

This extension allows sending a WCPS request to a server for server-side filtering, processing, and fusion, generally: analytics on a coverage server.

To this end, the Processing Extension adds query parameters to the server offering:

    Q={wcps-query}

where {wcps-query} is a syntactically and semantically correct WCPS query.

The output is a (possibly empty) list of coverages or scalars, depending on the query result type.

Example:

    http://acme.com/oapi/collections?Q=for $c in (ERA5-cube) return max( $c.temperature )

Note that the query parameter is operating on collection level as any number of coverages can be combined.

Example:

    http://acme.com/oapi/collections?Q=for $c in (ERA5-cube), $d in (DEM) return encode( $c.temperature > 20 and $d > 100, "image/png" )

Error conditions:

*    The query must be syntactically and semantically correct.
