description: >-
  Either a date-time or a period string that adheres to RFC3339. Examples:

  * A date-time: "2018-02-12T23:20:50Z"
  * A period: "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/2018-03-18T12:31:12Z" or "2018-02-12T00:00:00Z/P1M6DT12H31M12S"

  Only resources that have a temporal property that intersects the value of
  `time` are selected.

  If a resource has multiple temporal properties, it is the decision of the
  API implementor whether only a single temporal property is used to determine
  the extent or all relevant temporal properties.
