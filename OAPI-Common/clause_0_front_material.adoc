[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC has started a focused effort to extend their service standards into the Resource Oriented Architecture world. In the course of these efforts, some practices will prove to be common accross all OGC API standards. The purpose of this specification is to document those practices as they are identified. It also serves as a baseline against which changes can be discussed and validated. When suitably mature, this repository will be presented as a candidate "OWS Common" standard for Resource Oriented APIs.

Consistent with the architecture of the Web, this specification uses a resource architecture and specifies a RESTful service interface consistent with the IETF HTTP/HTTPS RFCs.

Discovery operations allow clients the interrogate the API to determine its capabilities and retrieve information (metadata) about this distribution of the resource. This includes the API definition of the server(s) as well as metadata about the resources provided by those servers.

Query operations allow features or values of feature properties to be retrieved from the underlying data store based upon selection criteria, defined by the client, on feature properties.

This standard defines the resources listed in Table 1. For an overview of the resources, see section <<core-overview,7.1 Overview>>.

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims or other intellectual property rights of which they may be aware that might be infringed by any implementation of the standard set forth in this document, and to provide supporting documentation.

*ISO Declaration*

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work. ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of electrotechnical standardization.

International Standards are drafted in accordance with the rules given in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.

The main task of technical committees is to prepare International Standards. Draft International Standards adopted by the technical committees are circulated to the member bodies for voting. Publication as an International Standard requires approval by at least 75 % of the member bodies casting a vote.
